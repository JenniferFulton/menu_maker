# menu_maker
A full-stack Django/Python project which users are able to plan their meals for the week. As a user you can add recipes and create a menu each week. You can also see and use the recipes all other users have added.

I decided to create a project that would help me in my every day life. Right now I use pen and paper to make a plan, ask my mom to send me recipes and search for recipes often. I wanted a place where I could do all of that in one place. My next step will be to make a grocery list for each week.
