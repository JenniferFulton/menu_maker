# menu_maker
Menu Maker is a full-stack Django/Python project which users are able to plan their meals for the week. As a user you can add recipes and create a menu each week. Once you've created a menu a grocery list will automatically populate for you!

I decided to create a project that would help me in my every day life. I was creating a menu with pen and paper and searching multiple places for recipes. I wanted to create a place where I could do all of that.
