# menu_maker
Menu Maker is a full-stack Django/Python project which users are able to plan their meals for the week. As a user you can add recipes and create a menu each week. You can also see and use the recipes all other users have added.

I decided to create a project that would help me in my every day life. Right now I use pen and paper to make a plan each week, ask my mom to send me recipes and search for recipes online often. I wanted to create a place where I could do all of that. My next step will be to make a grocery list for each week based on the ingredients in the recipes for that week.
